<h3>What?</h3>
The Eisenhower Matrix is named after the American president Eisenhower who was known for his productivity during his time in Office. This time management technique is based on labelling each task as: <b>important/not important</b>, and <b>urgent/not urgent</b>. You tackle them in relation to this.

<h3>How?</h3>
- To implement, list and add all your tasks and divide them into 4 quadrants:

<h4>I, DO [Urgent and important] </h4>
You should do these tasks immediately.

<h4>II, SCHEDULE [Important, but not urgent]</h4>
You should schedule a time for when you will tackle these tasks.

<h4>III, DELEGATE [Urgent, but not important]</h4>
It is best you delegate these tasks to your colleagues, or subordinates.

<h4>IV, DELETE [Neither important, not urgent]</h4>
You should eliminate these tasks altogether from your schedule.
